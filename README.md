# CodeAlpha_-Car-Price-Prediction-with-Machine-Learning-
This project focuses on building a machine learning model that predicts the selling price of used cars based on multiple features such as year of manufacture, fuel type, transmission, mileage, and more. The goal is to help buyers and sellers estimate fair car prices using data-driven insights.
